		<h2 class="center">Accessible is a review service that lists user-based accessibility recommendations within the local area for people who care about making the world a more accessible place.</h2>

		<h3 class="title1 center">Background</h3>

		<p class="subtext">
	The task of the project was to redesign yelp with an individual focus on a specific audience or use-case. I had the option to completely redesign Yelp and act as though it didnâ€™t exist, or I could create something that could co-exist with it today.
		</p>

		<div class="section">Identifying the Problem</div>
		<p class="text1">
			There is an endless amount of recommendations for restaurants and services all over the city, however there is little consideration to the accesibility to these places for a person who is disabled.
			<br><br>
		</p>

		<div class="section">Questions to Consider</div>
		<div class="text1 row">
			<div class="text1 col2">
			Who is the target demographic?
			<br>What are the needs of these users?
			<br>Why would someone want to use this product?
			<br>Is there an interest from the existing community?
			</div>
			<div class="text1 col2">
				What specific accesibile attributes are looked for?
			<br>What attributes can the product provide?
			<br>What attributes can the user provide?
			</div>
		</div>


		<h3 class="title1 center">Research</h3>

		<p class="subtext">
		I began my journey by first searching for what products were already exisiting in this space.
		</p>

		<div class="section1">Examination of Existing Products</div>
		<div class="text1 row">

			<div class="text1 col2">
				<img class="center down" src="../images/accessible/access.png" style="width:25%">
			</div>
		</div>
			<div class="text1 row">
			<div class="text1 col2">
				<div class="semibold">WheelMap</div>
				Focuses solely on wheelchair accessibility.
		    <br>Strictly a web app with limited information.
		    <br>No focus on community
		    <br>Accessibility rating broken down into categories: Partially, Fully, Not.
		    <br>Main focus: map.
			</div>
			<div class="text1 col2">
				<div class="semibold">AXS Map</div>
				First met with places that have no reviews.
				<br>Makes the site appear as though it has no data.
				<br>A nice and comprehensive rating system.
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="section">Identifying Pain Points</div>
		<p class="subtext">
		I decided to take use of the community of the internet and browsed around online at many different messaging boards, groups, and personal blogs.
		</p>

		<div class="semibold">Persona</div>
		<img class="hero" src="../images/accessible/persona.png" style="width:100%">

		<h3 class="title1 center">Implementation</h3>

		<p class="subtext">
		After looking at the information that I gathered from my research I needed to start thinking about the structure of the app and what features needed to be added to create something outstanding.
		</p>

		<div class="text1 row">
			<div class="text1 col2">
				<div class="section1">2 Review Systems</div>
				Accessibility ratings are the number one priority on the app, however while browsing around where to go it would also be helpful to know the general quality of the venue. Also including a system for rating the quality of a place would directly compete with yelp. I realized a problem of creating a separate space solely for people with disabilities and taking them out of the community of yelp. My solution was to integrate yelp into the app in a minor way and have it quickly link externally to the yelp page.
			</div>
			<div class="text1 col2">
				<div class="section1">User Filters</div>
			User filters allow for the user to choose what accessibility features to be shown on a review page. This allows for people with different needs to see only what they need to versus having all of the information shown.
			</div>
